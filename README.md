a) I handled the set up of variables by assigning  proper values (as asked in the assignment)to them and using the if function and then calling them using the read function.

b) My script should be executed by running it on the terminal of Ubuntu using the command <./gradingSystem.sh>, and then following the instructions provided.

c) I simply copied & pasted and assigned  the VERBOSE variables the required values, I was able to handle the VERBOSE variables quite easily.

d) If the compilation command would fail, the program would show me where the error is and it would automatically terminate the program, if the input from the user would be wrong I would simply use a while loop to re-enter the value so the program runs smoothly.

e) To get input from the user I would ask for the user to enter the required "Input" by displaying a message (echo " write something"), and then use the "read function" to get the input from the user.

f) For students grades in integers I used the if function for example (if [ $total -eq 90 ]), and so did i use a set of complex functions to handle strings.  so if the input is not in required characters it would automatically give an error.

g) I simply used this command (echo "$yourrecords " >>thefile.csv), so now everytime my script runs this command would keep adding records to the same file "thefile.csv". I also used "TAB" to seperate each input.
